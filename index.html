        <h2>What Nate Clark does best!</h2>
            <p>Nate Clark is the Senior Technical Director of Base Camp Coding Academy at Watervalley MS.
            Nate is very patient with his students when going over different coding languages or if people have
            questions on the current coding language they are working on due to his experiences in different languages.
            Nate is also very good at answering students questions by asking them a question to help them think for a bit
            in a different perspective. Once you get into a topic with Nate either code related or something both parties
            have an opinion or are passionate about the discussions can get pretty fun and informational when talking to one another.
            To me we probably have one of if not the best instructors to have when learning about different coding languages
            at an accelerated rate and that is why Nate is the GOAT!</p>
